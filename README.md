# ðŸ‘» riiip: RISCV Interactive Interpreter in Python

**this version is unstable and still under development**

The main goal of riiip is to make learning RISCV easy! 

riiip is inspired by the python shell, which was extremely helpful for me when I first learned to code. Simply type instructions in riiip and get instant feedback on what executed. Type a register name to get its value. Invalid instructions print helpful messages as they execute, so you know why they're wrong. Tricky edge cases with negative numbers and sign extentions are clearly indicated.

riiip is built entirely in python, making it easy to play around with and modify.

## TODO

- mem implementation
- ld
- st
- reset cmd line
- return None vs raise Error
- print formatting

## Using riiip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ad-s2dios/riiip.git
python3 riiip
```

## Example

```
ðŸ‘» Welcome to riiip 1.1! ðŸ‘»

initializing cpu...
all registers set to 0
PC set to 0

 ðŸ‘» addi t0, x0, 42
t0  = 0 + 42
    = 42
 ðŸ‘» sub t1, x0, t0
t1  = 0 - 42
    = -42
 ðŸ‘» t0
t0 : 0x 0000002a    42
 ðŸ‘» t1
t1 : 0x ffffffd6    -42
 ðŸ‘» addi a0, x0, 0x1234
do: immediate should have len <= 12 bits
    but 0x1234 exceeds this
===== ERROR =====
